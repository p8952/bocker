# Bocker
Docker implemented in around 100 lines of bash.

  * [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
  * [Example Usage](#example-usage)
  * [Functionality: Currently Implemented](#functionality-currently-implemented)
  * [Functionality: Not Yet Implemented](#functionality-not-yet-implemented)
  * [License](#license)

## Prerequisites

The following packages are needed to run bocker.

* [bridge-utils][]
* btrfs-progs
* curl
* iproute2
* iptables
* libcgroup-tools
* [procps][]
* util-linux >= 2.25.2
* coreutils >= 7.5

Because most distributions do not ship a new enough version of util-linux you will probably need to grab the sources from [here](https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/v2.25/) and compile it yourself.

Additionally your system will need to be configured with the following:

* A btrfs filesystem mounted under `/var/bocker`

For ease of use a Vagrantfile is included which will build the needed environment.

Even if you meet the above prerequisites you probably still want to **run bocker in a virtual machine**. Bocker runs as root and among other things needs to make changes to your network interfaces, routing table, and firewall rules. **I can make no guarantees that it won't trash your system**.

## Example Usage
