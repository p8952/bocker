# Bocker
Docker implemented in 100 lines of bash.

  * [Example Usage](#example-usage)
  * [Functionality: Currently Implemented](#functionality-currently-implemented)
  * [Functionality: Not Yet Implemented](#functionality-not-yet-implemented)
  * [License](#license)

## Prerequisites

The following packages are needed to run bocker.

* btrfs-progs
* iproute2
* iptables
* util-linux >= 2.25.2
* coreutils >= 7.5

Because most distributions do not ship a new enough version of util-linux you will probably need grab the sources from [here](https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/v2.25/) and compile it yourself.

Additionally your system will need to be configured with the following.

* A btrfs filesystem mounted under `/var/bocker`
* A network bridge called `bridge0` and an IP of 10.0.0.1/24
* IP forwarding enabled in `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`
* A firewall routing traffic from `bridge0` to a physical interface.
* A `base-image` which contains the filesystem to seed your container with.

For ease of use a Vagrantfile is included which will build the needed environment.

Even if you meet the above prerequisites you probably still want to **run bocker in a virtual machine**. Bocker runs as root and among other things needs to make changes to your network interfaces, routing table, and firewall rules. **I can make no guarantees that it wont trash your system**.

## Example Usage

```
$ bocker init base-image/
Created: img_84632

$ bocker images
IMAGE_ID
img_84632

$ bocker run img_84632 uname -sro
Linux 3.10.0-123.20.1.el7.x86_64 GNU/Linux

$ bocker ps
CONTAINER_ID       COMMAND
ps_12277           uname -sro

$ bocker logs ps_12277
Linux 3.10.0-123.20.1.el7.x86_64 GNU/Linux

$ bocker rm ps_12277
Removed: ps_12277

$ bocker run img_84632 which wget
which: no wget in (/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/root/bin)

$ bocker run img_84632 yum install -y wget
